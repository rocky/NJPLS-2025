    <p>Jane Street developers wrote an OCaml module to parse
     S-expressions.  The module is called <tt>Sexp</tt>. To get position
    information, sub-module
     <tt>Sexp.Annotated</tt> is used.
    </p>

    <p>Let me show that. Since looking at output can get long quickly,
    I am just going to run the most trivial example, parsing a
    single atom. Even though this is simple, it's enough to get the
    idea. [RUN CODE]</p>


    <p>I'm just showing the difference between parsing without
    position information* and with position information using
    <i>Sexp.Annotated</i>, which is coming up next.

      <p>There is what you get without position information.</p>

      <p>And if you just put in that <i>Annotated</i> in there, you
      get that instead.</p>

    <p>Here, I have just copied and formatted the output from the

    <p>The <em>essential</em> difference in data structure between

      <div style="color: blue; background-color:

	[DOWN line highlight] 11.2 ⟶ 11.2

      and <tt>Sexp.Annotated</tt> is that

      the Sexp.Annotated Atom is now a <em>tuple</em> and the first

      <div style="color: blue; background-color:

      is now a <em>position record</em>.

      <div style="color: blue; background-color:

      <p>I will summarize what we see here, but the structure is pretty straightforward.

	<div style="color: blue; background-color:
		    LightYellow">
	  [DOWN for line highlight] 11.4 ⟶ 11.4
	</div>
      </p>

      <p>
	There a type defined in <tt>Sexp.Annotate</tt>
	called "Tee". It can be either an Atom or a List. This is
	the same situation as in the parent module, <tt>Sexp</tt>.
      </p>

      <p>
	Both Atoms and Lists are tuple objects,
	the <em>first</em> element contains a <em>range</em>. We saw
	that in object shown in the last slide. The same kind if thing
	also happens in a List.

	<div style="color: blue; background-color:
		    LightYellow">
	  [DOWN for range highlight] 11.4 ⟶ 11.4
	</div>
      </p>

      <p>
	And a range is a record with a "pos" type for
	a start position and an end position.
	<div style="color: blue; background-color:
		    LightYellow">
	  [DOWN for pos highlight] 11.4 ⟶ 11.4
	</div>
      </p>

      <p>And a "pos" type here is a record with 3 things:
	a line number, a column number, and an "offset".
      </p>

      <p>The offset is basically a compact way to indicate both a line
	number and an offset as one number — the number of bytes from
	the start of the program. In a way it is redundant with for
	line and column. In some situations this might be more convenient.
	<div style="color: blue; background-color:
		    LightYellow">
	  [DOWN for full program] 11.4 ⟶ 11.4
	</div>
      </p>

      <p>
	Nowhere in sexplib do we have a place to store a container, that
	I can see. So that is be done outside of this library.
      </p>

      <p>Also, this library assumes that each parsed item lives in the
	<i>same</i> container. This kind of thing would not be true in
	a C-like language where the C-preprocessor can pull in text
	from several <tt>#include</tt> files into a single compilation
	unit. Even more weird, the C preprocesser allows for a single
	token to come from more than one file.
      </p>

      <p>
	However C and C derivatives are a little bit odd in this
	respect. Most programming languages do not allow this.</p>

      <p>As I said before, this scanning and parsing library marks
	regions of text, called "ranges". If you are writing an
	interpreter, you typically control the way debug information
	is stored. So saving the entire range can be done. Many
	interpreters such as for Python, Perl, or Ruby don't do this
	though. Etherium Solidity's debug tables is notable in that it
	does capture this.</p>

      <p>If you are compiling to machine code, the position information
	will need to invariably be stored DWARF format which does not
	support ranges. To compensate a little, you can mark the end
	of a range. And this is useful.
