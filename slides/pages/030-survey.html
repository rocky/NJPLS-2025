      I had surveys that you could fill out at registration. I'd like to both ask some of the same questions here, and give a summary of the results of that
      prior survey after asking the similar things here..
      <div style="color:
		  blue; background-color: LightYellow">[DOWN] #/3.1 ⟶ #3.1</div>
    </p>

    <p>
      Please raise your hand if you have written a compiler or have
    been part of a compiler-development team?
      [<em>Report count and compare with survey.</em>]
	<div style="color: blue; background-color:
		    LightYellow">[DOWN] #3.1 ⟶ #3.1></div>
    </p>

    <p>
      Please raise your hand if the compiler course you took described debuggers, not more detail than  a passing remark.
      [<em>Report count and compare with survey.</em>]
	<div style="color: blue; background-color:
    LightYellow">[DOWN] #3.1 ⟶ #3.1></div>
    </p>

    <p>
      Or what it takes to support run-time debugging.
      [<em>Report count and compare with survey.</em>]
	<div style="color: blue; background-color:
    LightYellow">[DOWN] #3.1 ⟶ #3.1></div>
    </p>

    <p>
      Now please raise your hand if you have used <i>uncompyle6</i>,
      or <i>decompyle3</i>?
    </p>

    <p>
      When was the last time you heard a talk exclusively debuggers as a topic, such as you might find for parsing, or compilers in general? Please raise your hand if you've heard a talk in say the last two years. And no ever?
      <div style="color: blue; background-color: LightYellow">[Next] #3.1⟶ #/4
