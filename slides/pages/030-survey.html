	I had a survey that you could fill out before. I'd like to ask some of the same questions here, and give a summary of the results of that
	survey...
      </p>
      <p>
	Please raise your hand if you filled out the survey.
      <div style="color:

	[DOWN to taken a compiler course?] #/3.1 ⟶ #3.1</div>

      <p>
	Please raise your hand if you have taught or taken a college-level
	compiler course.
      </p>

      <p>Please keep your hands up.
      <div style="color:
		  blue; background-color: LightYellow">
	[DOWN to written a compiler?] #/3.1 ⟶ #3.1</div>
      </p>

      <p>Now keep them up if the compiler course you took or taught
	described debuggers or run-time tracing and error reporting.
      </p>
      <p>I mean in more detail than a passing remark, such as "code
	optimization messes up debugging". [<em>Report count and
	compare with survey.</em>]
	<div style="color:
		    blue; background-color: LightYellow">
	  [DOWN to talk on debuggers as a general topic] #3.1 ⟶ #3.1>
	</div>
      </p>

      <p>
	When was the last time you heard a talk <i>exclusively</i> on
	debuggers as a <i>topic</i>. I mean such as you might find for
	parsing, or compilers in general? Not a talk about a
	particular debugger or a debugger embedded in particular
	compiler system.
      </p>

      <p>
	Let's say the last two years? ...
	<div style="color: blue; background-color: LightYellow">
	  [DOWN to Ever?] #3.1⟶ #/3.1

	And <i>ever</i>?
