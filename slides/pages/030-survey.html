      <li class="fragment">Have you ever taken or taught a

	As I mentioned, I had a survey for this talk. So please raise
	your hand if you filled out the survey.  [COMPARE with the
	total number of responses]
      <div style="color:
		  blue; background-color: LightYellow">
	[DOWN to taken a compiler course?] #/3.1 ⟶ #3.1</div>
      </p>

      <p>
	I see many people here haven't taken the survey. Please raise
	your hand if you have <i>taken</i>, or taught a compiler course.
      </p>

      <p>Please keep your hands up. [REPORT COUNT - this is most
	everyone]
      <div style="color:
		  blue; background-color: LightYellow">
	[DOWN to written a compiler?] #/3.1 ⟶ #3.1</div>
      </p>

      <p>Now keep them up if <em>any</em> of the compiler courses
	you <i>took</i>, or taught, described what a <i>compiler</i>
	needs to do to support debuggers or run-time tracing and error
	reporting.
      </p>
      <p>And here, I mean in more detail than a passing remark, such
	as "code optimization messes up debugging". [<em>Report
	count</em>]
      </p>

      <p>Those of you without your hand up (which is most of you) are
	in the right place. But honestly,
	after 15 minutes I am not going to do justice to this topic
      </p>

      <p>
	In the survey, most if not all of the respondants have never
	attended a talk on debuggers as a broad <i>topic</i>.  And
	here, I mean describing debuggers as a topic in the kind of way
	that you'd describe scanning, parsing, or code generation as
	a general process.
