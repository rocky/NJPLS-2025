	I had a survey that you could fill out before. Please raise your hand if you filled out the survey.

      <p>
	Please raise your hand if you have <i>taken</i>
	or <i>taught</i> a college-level compiler course.
      </p>

      <p>Please keep your hands up.
      <div style="color:
		  blue; background-color: LightYellow">
	[DOWN to written a compiler?] #/3.1 ⟶ #3.1</div>
      </p>

      <p>Now keep them up if any of the compiler courses you took or
	taught described debuggers or run-time tracing and error
	reporting.
      </p>
      <p>And here, I mean in more detail than a passing remark, such
	as "code optimization messes up debugging". [<em>Report count
	and compare with survey.</em>]
	<div style="color:
		    blue; background-color: LightYellow">
	  [DOWN to talk on debuggers as a general topic] #3.1 ⟶ #3.1>
	</div>
      </p>

      <p>
	In the survey, most (75%) of the respondants report never having
	attended a talk on debuggers as a <i>topic</i>. Again, here I mean such
	as you might find for parsing, or compilers in general? Not a
	talk about a particular debugger or a debugger embedded in
	particular compiler system. Or a concept in debugging, like
	reverse execution.
