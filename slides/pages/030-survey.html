	I had a survey that you could fill out before. I'd like to ask some of the same questions here, and give a summary of the results of that
	survey...
      </p>
      <p>
	Please raise your hand if you filled out the survey.
      <div style="color:

      <p>
	Now please raise your hand if you have written a compiler, or have
	been part of a compiler-development team?

      <p>
	Please raise your hand have taken a compiler
	course, <i>and</i> the compiler course you took described
	debuggers.</p>
      <p>
	I mean in more detail than a passing remark, such as
	"code optimization messes up debugging". [<em>Report count and
	compare with survey.</em>]
	<div style="color: blue; background-color: LightYellow">
	  [DOWN] #3.1 ⟶ #3.1
	</div>
      </p>

      <p>
	Please raise your if the compiler course descrbied support
	for run-time tracing, error reporting, or debugging.

	<div style="color: blue; background-color: LightYellow">
	  [DOWN] #3.1 ⟶ #3.1>
	</div>
      </p>

      <p>
	When was the last time you heard a talk <i>exclusively</i> on
	debuggers as a <i>topic</i>. I mean such as you might find for
	parsing, or compilers in general? Not a talk about a particular debugger.
	Let's say the last two years? ...
