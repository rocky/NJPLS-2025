    decompilers, nor runtime support for debugging

    <p>Today, I will mostly talk only a <i>little</i> bit about what a
      compiler should consider to provide error-position information
      at run time. But I'll try to broaden this a little and mention
      support run-time debugging more generally.</p>

    <p>Here are just a <i>few</i> of the book on compilers of the many
      that exist. I've tried to include the more popular books. But if
	  I missed some, you can let me know afterwards.</p>
    <p>Please raise your hand if you've read any of these books? (I'm
      in a survey kind of mood today). [REPORT COUNT]
    </p>

    <p>I would <em>love</em> to report that what I am going to say
      here you can find in greater detail in <em>any</em> of these
      compiler books.

      But you can't. And that's a big part of why I am here.</p>
    <p>I could have included probably at least two dozen more
      books.</p>
    <p>
      I have here some books that are out of print. But this just
      shows that this phenonemon is not new. I also have some rather
      specialized books, such as one Pascal, or advanced compiler
      writing. But you won't find a specialized <i>compiler</i> book
      that includes information on debugging support and debuggers.

      When I searched for books on "debuggers" on <code>Amazon.com</code>, here is is what turns up.
    </p>
    <p>
      The book in the middle, "Building a Debugger", is about building
      an Intel x86 debugger; it does not seem to be hooked into a
      compiler or language.
    </p>

    <p>
      The book on <i>gdb</i> is most-likley the
      <i>gdb</i> manual, possibly massaged a little.

    <p>
      The first book "How Debuggers Work" from 19 years ago, I have a
      quote from the review, which you can read here. It is still in
      its first revision.
    </p>
    <p>
      Does that mean <i>nothing</i> has changed in 19 years? From what
      I can tell, the book treats a compiler as a black box. If
      someone has read this book, and I am wrong, please let me
      know.</p>

    <div style="color: blue; background-color:

      [DOWN to compiler books with debuggers] 4.2 ⟶ 4.2
    </div>

    <p>These are two books, that do describe debuggers as part of the
      compiler. But the topic is specific for the compiler system that
      is the focus of the book. I wonder how many people are familiar
      with this. [I won't ask for a survey here.]
    </p>

    <p>
      The prevailing view found in compiler books and debugger books, is
      that these are <i>separate</i> topics.
    </p>
    <p>
      This reminds me of a couple of places where I worked, where we had
      separate departments for computer backups and computer
      restores.</p>
    <p>
      The first group, backup software, was group to work in &mdash;
      the atomosphere was causal and relaxed.</p>

    <p>
      In contrast, the department-of-restores group was always under
      constant pressure and never could get its act together.</p>

    <p>It feels to me that this is, too often, the current situation
      with compilers and debuggers.
