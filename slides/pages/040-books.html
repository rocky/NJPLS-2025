	Today, I will mostly talk only a <i>little</i> bit about what a
	compiler should consider to provide error-position information
	at run time. I'll try to broaden this a little at the end to
	mention support for run-time debugging more generally. My 2010
	paper cited in the last slide has more information than I will
	have time to give today.</p>

      <p>
	Here are just a <i>few</i> of the books on compilers from
	the <i>many</i> that exist. These are the more popular books that
	are sold on <i>amazon.com</i>. These cover all of the books that
	people noted in the survey.
      </p>

      <p>
	I would <em>love</em> to report that what I am going to say
	here you can find in greater detail in <em>any</em> of these
	compiler books.

	  [DOWN Fragment to "you can't"] 4.1 ⟶ 4.1
	</div>
      </p>

      <p>
	But you can't. And that's a big part of why I am here.
      </p>
      <p>I could have included at least two dozen more books. I also
	looked at the <i>all</i> of the class lecture notes people
	mentioned in the survey.  None of those appear to cover the
	topic of this talk either.
      </p>
      <p>
	I have here some books that are out of print. But this just
	shows that this silence on the topic is not new. I also have
	some rather <i>specialized</i> books, such as one on Pascal
	compilers, or advanced compiler writing. But you won't find a
	specialized <i>compiler</i> book that includes information on
	debugging support and debuggers.
      </p>
      <p>
	It should come as no surprise then, that if the popular books on
	compilers are silent about debuggers and debugging support, then
	the compilers that people <i>write</i> don't have debuggers
	either.
      </p>
      <p>
	And this is confirmed in the survey. Over 90% of the people who
	have said they were part of a compiler team, report that the
	compiler that they worked on had no debugger.

      When I searched for books on "debuggers" on <i>amazon.com</i>, here is is what turns up.
    </p>
    <p>
      The book in the middle, "Building a Debugger", is about building
      an Intel x86 debugger; it assumes compiler writers know what to
      do.
    </p>

    <p>
      I guess the same would be true book for the on <i>gdb</i>; It is
      most-likley the
      <i>gdb</i> manual, possibly massaged a little.
      <div style="color: blue; background-color:

      </div>
    </p>

    <p>
      The first book "How Debuggers Work" is 19 years old. I have a
      quote from a review, which you can read here. It is still in
      its first revision.
    </p>
    <p>
      Does that mean <i>nothing</i> has changed in 19 years? From what
      I can tell, the book treats a compiler as a black box. If
      someone has read this book, and I am wrong, please let me
      know.</p>

    <div style="color: blue; background-color:
		LightYellow">
      [DOWN to compiler books with debuggers] 4.2 ⟶ 4.2
    </div>

    <p>These are two books, that do describe debuggers as part of the
      compiler. But the topic is <i>specific</i> for the compiler
      described in the book. And I wonder how many people are familiar
      with either of these. [I won't ask for a survey here.]
    </p>

    <p>
      The prevailing view found in compiler books and debugger books, is
      that these are <i>separate</i> topics.
    </p>
    <p>
      This reminds me of a couple of places where I worked, where we had
      <i>separate</i> departments for computer backups, and for computer
      restores.</p>
    <p>
      The first group, backup software, was group to work in &mdash;
      the atomosphere was causal and relaxed.</p>

    <p>
      In contrast, the department-of-restores group was always under
      constant pressure and never could get its act together.</p>

    <p>It feels to me that this is, too often, the current situation
      with compilers and debuggers.
