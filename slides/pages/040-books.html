  <p class="fragment" align="left">... that mention neither debuggers,
    decompilers, nor runtime support for debugging
  </p>
  <aside class="notes">
    <p>Today, I'd like to talk a little bit about what a compiler needs
      to do to provide error position information at run time. And what
      is needed to support run-time debugging.</p>

    <p>Here are some popular book compilers of the many that are out.
      Please raise your hand if you've read any of these books? (I'm in a survey kind of mood today).
    </p>

    <p>I would <em>love</em> to report that what I am going to say here you
      can find in greater about run-time support for debugging detail
      in <em>any</em> of these compiler books.

    <p>But you can't. And that's a big part of why I am here. I could
      have included probably at least two dozen more books.  I have
      here some books that are out of print. But this just shows that
      this phenonemon is not new. I also have some rather specialized
      books, such as one Pascal, or advanced compiler writing. But you
      won't a specialized compiler book that includes information on
      debugging support and debuggers.

    When I searched for "debuggers" on <code>Amazon.com</code> books, here is is what turns up.
  </p>
  <p>
    The book on building a debugger is about an Intel x86 debugger; it does not seem to be
    hooked into a compiler or language.
  </p>

  <p>
    The book on <i>gdb</i> is most-likley the
    <i>gdb</i> manual, possibily massaged a little.
    <div style="color: blue; background-color:

      [DOWN Fragment] 4.2 ⟶ 4.2
    </div>
  </p>

  <p>The first book "How Debuggers Work", I quote from the a review, which you can read here. The prevailing view found in compiler books
    and debugger books is that these are <i>separate</i> topics that not very much related to one another.
  </p>
  <p>
    This reminds me of a couple of places where I worked where the
    department of computer backups was a separate department from the
    department of computer restores.  The backup group was group to
    work in &mdash; the atomosphere was causal and relaxed. The department of
    restores group was always under constant pressure and never could
    get its act together. It feels to me, this is the current
    situation with debuggers for too many compilers.
    <div style="color: blue; background-color:
		LightYellow">
      [DOWN] 4.2 ⟶ 5.1
    </div>
  </p>

  <p>These are two books, that do describe debuggers as part of the compiler. How many people are familiar with these?
    [Take a count of first book; and then second book].
