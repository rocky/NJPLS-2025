    Where can a program come from?
    <ul>
      <li class="fragment">a file in a file system,</li>
      <li class="fragment">a stream from a socket or piped into a compiler,</li>
      <li class="fragment">a piece of an "archive"-format file:
          Java classfile <tt>jar</tt>, Python <tt>wheel</tt>
          (<tt>zip</tt>), or machine-code library, etc.,</li>
      <li class="fragment">a string or AST data-structure created inside a program
          at runtime, e.g. HTML templating system for Web framework, an
          AI auto-learning system</li>
    </ul>

	Program source code comes from <em>somewhere</em>. It is useful
	for the programmer and IDE's to know <em>where</em> it came
	from. So what are some possibilities?

	<div style="color: blue; background-color:
		    LightYellow">
	  [DOWN fragment to file in filesystem] 8.1 ⟶ 8.1
	</div>
      </p>
      <p>
	As I said before, a file in the file system is the most common
	possibility.
      </p>
      <p>A problem I see in many systems, is a weakness in being able to deal
	with positions when working containers <i>other</i> than a file in a filesystem.

      </p>
      <p> So let's go into other kinds of containers.
	<div style="color: blue; background-color:
		    LightYellow">
	  [DOWN fragment to stream] 8.1 ⟶ 8.1
	</div>
      </p>

    <p>Interactive input; or more generally a stream from a socket
      which might happen in remote execution. Or a stream piped into a
      compiler. The weakness I see here is an inability of the system
      to be able to show the source text in an IDE. Here, input is
      often one line long. So it is useful to be able to give position
      information in finer granularity just a line.
    <div style="color: blue; background-color:
		LightYellow">
      [DOWN fragment to archive member] 8.1 ⟶ 8.1
    </div>
    </p>

    <p>a piece of an archive-format file. Java "class file" or
      <tt>jar</tt> files are like this. In Python, <tt>wheels</tt> are
      zip files.
    <div style="color: blue; background-color:
		LightYellow">
      [DOWN fragment reveal] 8.1 ⟶ 8.1
    </div>
    </p>

    <p>Another possibility is a string or AST data-structure created
      inside a program at runtime; for example an HTML templating
      system for Web framework, or self-modifying code in an
      auto-learning system.
    </p>
    <p>Again, IDE's and debuggers are sometimes weak in being able to show
    source text when the container is of this type.
    <div style="color: blue; background-color:
		LightYellow">
      [NEXT] 8.1 ⟶ 9.1
    </div>
