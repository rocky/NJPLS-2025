    <ul>
      <li class="fragment">a file in a file system,</li>
      <li class="fragment">a stream from a socket or piped into a compiler,</li>
      <li class="fragment">a piece of an "archive"-format file:
          Java classfile <tt>jar</tt>, Python <tt>wheel</tt>
          (<tt>zip</tt>), or machine-code library, etc.,</li>
      <li class="fragment">a string or AST data-structure created inside a program
          at runtime, e.g. HTML templating system for Web framework, an
          AI auto-learning system</li>

	Program source code comes from <em>somewhere</em>. It is useful
	for the programmer and IDE's to know <em>where</em> it came
	from. So what are some possibilities?

	<div style="color: blue; background-color:
		    LightYellow">
	  [DOWN fragment reveal] 8.2 ⟶ 8.2
	</div>
      </p>
      <p>
	As I said before, a file in the file system is the most common
	possibility.
      </p>
      <p>A problem I see in many systems, is a weakness in being able to deal
	with positions when working containers other than a file in a filesystems.

      </p>
      <p> So let's go into other kinds of containers.
	<div style="color: blue; background-color:
		    LightYellow">
	  [DOWN fragment reveal] 8.2 ⟶ 8.2
	</div>
      </p>

    <p>a stream from a socket which might happen in remote
      execution. Or a stream piped into a compiler. The weakness I see
      here is an inability of the system to be able to show the source
      text in an IDE. Here, input is often one line long. So it is
      useful to be able to give position information in finer granularity just a line.
    <div style="color: blue; background-color:
		LightYellow">
      [DOWN fragment reveal] 8.2 ⟶ 8.2
    </div>
    </p>

    <p>a piece of an archive-format file. In Java, "class file" are
      <tt>jar</tt> files. In Python, <tt>wheels</tt> are zip files.
    <div style="color: blue; background-color:
		LightYellow">
      [DOWN fragment reveal] 8.2 ⟶ 8.2
    </div>
    </p>

    <p>Another possibility is a string or AST data-structure created
      inside a program at runtime, for example an HTML templating
      system for Web framework, or AI self-modying code in an
      auto-learning system.
    </p>
    <p>Again, IDE's and debuggers are often weak in being able to show
    source text when the container is of this type.
    <div style="color: blue; background-color:
		LightYellow">
      [NEXT] 8.2 ⟶ 9.1
    </div>
    </p>
