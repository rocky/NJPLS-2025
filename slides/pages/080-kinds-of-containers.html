    Where can a program come from?
    <ul>
      <li class="fragment">a file in a file system,</li>
      <li class="fragment">interactive input; a stream from a socket</li>
      <li class="fragment">a piece of an "archive"-format file:
          Java classfile <tt>jar</tt>, Python <tt>wheel</tt>
          (<tt>zip</tt>), or machine-code library, etc.,</li>
      <li class="fragment">a string or AST data-structure created inside a program
          at runtime, e.g. HTML templating system for Web framework, an
          AI auto-learning system</li>
    </ul>

	Program source code comes from <em>somewhere</em>. It is
	useful for a debugger, profiler, or IDE to know <em>where</em>
	it came from. So what are some possibilities?

	<div style="color: blue; background-color:
		    LightYellow">
	  [DOWN fragment to file in filesystem] 8.1 ⟶ 8.1
	</div>
      </p>
      <p>
	As I said before, a file in the file system is the most common
	possibility.
      </p>
      <p>A problem I see in many systems, is a <i>weakness</i> in
	being able to deal with positions when working with
	containers <i>other</i> than a file in a filesystem.

      </p>
      <p> So let's go into other kinds of containers.
	<div style="color: blue; background-color:
		    LightYellow">
	  [DOWN fragment to stream] 8.1 ⟶ 8.1
	</div>
      </p>

    <p>Programs can come from interactive input; or more generally a
      stream from a socket. A weakness I see in compiler systems,
      is the inability to be able to show the source-text fragment in
      this situation. Here, input is often one line long. So it is
      useful to be able to give position information in finer
      granularity just a line.
    <div style="color: blue; background-color:
		LightYellow">
      [DOWN fragment to archive member] 8.1 ⟶ 8.1
    </div>
    </p>

    <p>In Java, a "class file", or <tt>jar</tt>, is in archive of a set of files. In Python, <tt>wheels</tt> are
      zip files.
    <div style="color: blue; background-color:
		LightYellow">
      [DOWN fragment reveal] 8.1 ⟶ 8.1
    </div>
    </p>

    <p>Another possibility is a string or AST data-structure created
      inside a program at runtime; for example an HTML templating
      system for Web framework, or self-modifying code in an
      auto-learning system.
    </p>
    <p>Again, IDE's and debuggers are sometimes weak in being able to show
    source text when the container is of this type.
    <div style="color: blue; background-color:
		LightYellow">
      [NEXT] 8.1 ⟶ 9.1
    </div>
    </p>
