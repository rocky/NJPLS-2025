	This talk is going to be a little than many of the talks today, and I suppose in talks you've encounter in general. Although I'd rather be talking about cool algorithms or cool code I've written (and I will show a little bit about the code I've written), here most of the talk is going to be descriptive of what collective knowledge about a topic. But as far as I can tell this topic hasn't been well described or disseminated or available in a way that can be easily used.

      <p>But let's find out if that's really the case....

      <p>Oh, also some of the slide that appear on the screen might be a little different from what I say. I think that's a good thing though. It keeps you on your toes.
