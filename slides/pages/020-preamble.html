	This talk is going to be a little bit different from many of
	the talks today. And different from talks I'd like to give.
      </p>
      <p>I'd rather be describing cool algorithms and code I've
	written. (I will show a <i>little</i> bit of code I've
	written.)</p>
      <p>
	Here, though, most of the talk is <i>descriptive</i>. It is
	collective knowledge about a topic. But as far as I can tell,
	this topic hasn't been described or disseminated well.  It is
	not available in a way that can be easily used.
      </p>

      <p>But let's find out if that's really the case....

      <p>Oh, also... some of the slides on the screen might be a
      little different from what I say. I think that's a good thing
      though &mdash; it keeps you on your toes.
