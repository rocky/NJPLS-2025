	This talk is going to be a little bit different from many of
	the talks today.
      </p>
      <p>
	Most of <i>this</i> talk is <i>descriptive</i>. It is implicit
	collective knowledge about a topic. But as far as I can tell,
	this topic hasn't been described or disseminated well.  It is
	not available in a way that can <i>easily</i> be used by
	compiler writers.
      <p>And according to the survey for this talk, most respondants
	either wrote a compiler or were part of a compiler team.
      </p>

      <p>
	Oh, also... some of the slides on the screen might be a little
	different from what I say. I think that's a good thing though
	&mdash; it keeps you on your toes.
      </p>
      <p>
	Time is going to be short, and I can squeeze in a little more
	information this way.
