      I have endeavord to show that this aspect of providing run-time
      support for debuggers has been neglected in compiler books and
      compiler classes. I've gone into one area, but there are several
      others. Support for fast breakpoints is a whole topic on its own.
    </p>
    <p>
      This semester I have gave one lecture in one compiler course to
      show how to improve position information in the course compiler.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you teach a compiler course and would like me to suggest how to
      augment your course material to support debuggers and run-time debugging,
      I may be available or may be able to help (if the response is not overwhelming).
    </p>
    <p>
      Likewise if you are writing a compiler textbook, consider adding
      something about run-time information for debuggers. Or again,
      I may be able to provide some text here.
