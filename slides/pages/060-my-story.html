	My first full-time computer job was at IBM T.J. Watson Research Center.
      </p>
      <p>
	The project I was hired for was to help develop a compiler for
	IBM's RISC CPU called POWER.</p>
      <p>Back then, it was called 801 which is the building number on
	the photo you see here.  This building is about 40 miles North
	of here and a little bit East.
      </p>

    <p>We needed a debugger for our compiler, and I was offered
      the opportunity write it. I declined.</p>

    <p>I recall thinking, why would I want to do that? Instead, I
      would rather write a paper on using alpha-beta search to perform
      some specific code optimization.

      Now fast forward 12 years of IBM tanking, and my switching from
      a research environment in suburban, upper-class Westchester, to
      a stock-trading company in New York City where I live.</p>
    <p>I was a systems administrator....

      That's me on the bottom..
    </p>
    <p>
      My job there was simply to keep the computers working
      reliably. I was basically a high-tech boiler operator. But one
      who got paid 20% more than I did at IBM Research. And on top of
      that, I got a $20K bonus at the end of the year, because they
      liked me...
    </p>
    <p>I wrote a bash debugger in this time frame.

      <p> In this environment, time is money. (This is the only equation I'll use in this entire talk.)</p>
      <p>
      The code that system admnistrator's job were tasked to run was
      often suspect, or just plain buggy.  And this was the reason our
      computers were invariably crashing.

    <p>If we could not <em>demonstrate</em> there was a problem
      in the program, we'd have to get bigger, costlier, and faster
      computers with more memory ... <em>And</em> it would take longer to reboot
      these bigger boxes with more memory.</p>

    <p>It is true that testing, and proving programs will help
    here, but things can still go wrong. Think about say a spacecraft mission. Maybe it's gamma
    rays that cause a problem. The spaceship is in motion, you gotta
    find and fix a problem in a limited amount of time or a billion dollars is gone.
