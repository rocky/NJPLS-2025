    <p>Now I'd like to briefly talk about a common class of debuggers that is easy to write a debugger for.
    </p>

    <p>The topic of writing a debugger would, alone, easily take
    hours. But I do want to give some idea here to encourage compiler
    writers think about and include a debugger.</p>

    <p>I've noticed when the first debugger is written for a
    compilation system that doesn't have one, you will invariable find
    a lot of mistakes in position reporting.</p>

    <p>Here is why. In an error report, while saying that you are on
    line <em>x</em> when you are really at line <em>x+1</em> is
    unhelpful, it is too often tolerated. But inside a debugger, if a
    position is off by one line, users will quickly notice it and find
    it intolerable.
    </p>

    <p>In high-level dynamic interpreters providing debugger support
      it is straight-forward.</p>

    <p>So what do I mean by "high-level dynamic interpreters"?
    "Dynamic" just means that the language allows allows code to be
    created and run runtime. Here, it doesn't matter whether the
    system is an interpreter or there is a fast compiler that can link
    in the new code at runtime. Often this done by an <i>eval()</i>
    function.</p>

    <p>The new code evaluated could come from string or it could be an
    AST built at runtime. The "high-level" part is also kind of a wiggle
    term. What I mean here is that the intermediate language that
    the interpreter runs off of uses higher-level objects, such as
    objects of the language as opposed to register values and memory
    addresses.

    <p>
      Here are some Languages that fit into this category: Python,
      Ruby, Perl, POSIX shells, are just a few of the many languages
      that fit into this category. Lua, and OCaml, and many Lisps like
      Scheme and Emacs Lisp support both an interpreted as well as a
      compiled code.
    </p>


    <p>An import aspect about interpreters for these languages is that
    the compiler writer has a lot of control over the runtime
    environment.
      </p>

    <p>Something else that is a hallmark of "high-level dynamic interpreters"
      is that these systems come with an interactive shell or REPL (Read
      Eval Print Loop), that allows you to type in some code in the language
      and have that code run.

      Debugger pattern.
    </p>

    <pre>
      <code class="hljs python">
      def callback_hook(event):
         instrospect stack;
         if event and stack indicate something we are interested in:
           run interactive command loop make use of eval/exec
      register_callback(callback_hook)
    </code>
    </pre>
  </div>
<aside class="notes">
  <p>
    <p>In this kind of situation, here is how a debuggers typically
      works. The runtime system allows you register callback function
      which triggers whenever a particular event occurs. Here, events
      are things like calls and returns from functions, raising
      exceptions, user-defined breakpoint, after each "instruction"
      (this is usually not done though), and finally, before each new
      "statement". I use "statement" very loosely. In too many
      systems, like Python and Perl5, among others, it is every time an
      instruction changes line number. And in fact the mapping from
      instruction to source code is called "line number" table.
    </p>

    <p>One thing I would like to advocate is moving for is moving away
    from the term "line number. I don't have a good replacement term
    for this though. If someone has suggestions, please let me know.
    </p>

    <p>Given this special environment, here is the design for a simple
    debugger. Wrap the program you want to run around some code that
    registers callbacks. And then inside the callback function
    instropsect on the current call stack, to get position and
    variable information as needed. Then bascally you can go into
    REPL which isn't all that different from the shell that the
    programming environment already provides. You might provide
    additional functions for stack introspection, and setting
    breakpoints, and showing or setting aspects around the debugger
    environment.
    </p>

    <p>In providing a commands, I suggest building off some existing
      debugger command language. For the debuggers I've written, I
      modelled them off of <i>gdb</i>. By doing this you not only get
      a guide towards what commands to provide, but you also make it
      easier for your users to do complicated things more quickly, if
      they already know `gdb`. And if they don't, should they have to
      use <i>gdb</i> in the future, they will have to learn less.
      </p>

    <p>Not only does this make it easier for humans to understand your
    debugger, but it makes it easier for programs to do so as well!
    Here is an amusing story. After I wrote a debugger for bash, I
    though I'd hook it into the debugger front-end system that was
    popular 20 years ago or so called `ddd`. It didn't have a single
    configuration file for specifying characteristics of your
    debugger, there were just about 100 places of C++ code that you
    had to change. So I'd search to find what code was
    gdb-specific. And then I added, code of the form "and do that for
    my bash debugger as well". After I got this done, I was was
    surprised so see that on its own it created a custom "debugger
    settings" page which had the names of all of the setting that
    could be changed in the program, but I had never entered this
      explicitly. How did it know this?
      </p>

    <p>
      What it did was doing was running a <em>help</em> to get a list
      of all of the settings, and then issuing a command to show the
    value of each one, and then parsing the output to determine the
    *type* the setting in order to make a custom boolean checkbox or a
    radio box or integer slider!
      </p>

    <p>
      Now I want to talk about supporting breakpoints. This simplest
      and most straightforward way to support breakpoints and the
      other callback events is simply to augment the interpreter with
      a test to see if a debug or trace flag has been set. The problem
      with this is that it can add a lot of overhead. Especially if
      this test is done every virtual instruction or every
      source-mapping change.

      One simple and often used solution to speed this kind of thing
      up is to have two interpreters, one that contains the checks and
      one that doesn't. When debugging is turned on, or turned on for
      some particular function or module, then the debug interpreter
      is used. In Lisp, OCaml and other systems which support compiled
      and interpreted code this is one way that they support better
      run-time debugging.
