  <h1>Out-of-Sync Issues that can arise with Containers</h1>

    <p>As I said, the reason we want to store a container name is so
    that debuggers can find the source text or so report that
    container in an runtime error message. Often the file mentioned
    will be opened and the source position will be shown in a debugger
      or in such an error message.
    </p>

    <p>But this opens up the possibility for another problem: the
    source text that the compiler or interpreter read the program
    isn't the same as what the programmer or rather programmer's IDE
    sees.
    <div style="color: blue; background-color:

    [DOWN Fragment] 9.1 ⟶ 9.2
    </div>
    </p>

    <p>
      Mismatches in the hierarchy surrounding a container. A file
      name might be indicated, but not the directory the file is under,
      or on the same underlying storage (the file might be on a
      different require a machine name, or a different git repository
    </p>

      In the street address analogy, there are other building
      named 250 but not 25 Vesey Street. And there can be other 250
      Vesey Streets, just not in New York city.
      <div style="color: blue; background-color:
		  LightYellow">
	[DOWN Fragment] 9.1 ⟶ 9.2
      </div>
    </p>

    <p>Similarly, the container or version control repository are the
      same but the version of the file is different. This often happens when the
      file is source text gets modified after the program starts running.
    </p>
    <p>Another common situation is that the file is in version control
    but the version that was compiled and the version that is
      currently checked out is a different.

  <h1>Out-of-Sync Issues Remedies for Containers</h1>

    <ul>
      <li>SIP hash of source text</li>
      <li>Storing source text inside debug information</li>
      <li>Passing source text over the network (for remote execution)
    </ul>
  </p>

      One way to detect this problem is to store a checksum or hash
      of the source text. Python has the ability to store a SIP hash
      inside bytecode for the purpose of making sure source code
      matches. Python selected the SIP hash to be relatively fast, while
      also keeping the possibility of for hash collisions low.
    </p>

    <p>Another possibility that is sometimes used, is to store the
    source text inside a debug file. The debug tables for Etherium
    Solidity work this way. The downside of this is that it might lead
    to huge debug files. Solidity programs however are generally very
      short
    </p>

    <p>Another technique used a bit in remote debugging is to have the
    the source text sent across the network on request. So a local IDE
    doesn't try to access the source text n certain cases, even if the
    source text exists locally. A downside of this is that a lot of
    information might be passed over the network if you are not
    careful and information isn't cached.</p>

    <p>
      Now that we've described containers we can focus on the part
      that most people think of when talking about a position: the
      location inside that container.
