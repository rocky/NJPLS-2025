      <p>As I said, the reason we want to store a container name is so
	that debuggers can access the container and show the source text
	inside a debugger or in a runtime error message.
      </p>

      <p>But this raises the possibility of another problem: the
	source text that the compiler or interpreter read isn't the
	same as what the programmer's debugger or IDE sees.
	<div style="color: blue; background-color:

	  [DOWN File name is ambigous] 9.1 ⟶ 9.1
	</div>
      </p>

      <p>
	For example, if an incomplete file name is given, but not the
	directory that is under, this can lead to a mismatch. I have
	encountered this problem too many times. Therefore, in my debuggers
	I always store a fully resolved file name as well as a mapping
	from short name to full path name when the runtime-system
	provides only a short file name.
      </p>

      <p>And over time, I have seen intrepeters shift from short name to
      fully resolved file name in storing filename in debugger information.
      </p>

	In the street address analogy, there are other buildings
	named 250 but not 250 Vesey Street. And there can be other 250
	Vesey Streets, just not in New York City.
	<div style="color: blue; background-color:
		    LightYellow">
	  [DOWN to Version is different] 9.1 ⟶ 9.1
	</div>
      </p>

      <p>The file might be on a different machine or underlying
	storage. Or course, this is not a problem if
	the <i>contents</i> are the same. For example, if the file is
	in a version-control system <em>and</em> it is the same
	version, then we're okay. <em>But we'd need to check that!</em>
      </p>
      <p>By the way, I would bet that this kind of thing is not
	addressed in the book on debuggers from 19 years ago.
	<div style="color: blue; background-color:
		    LightYellow">
	  [DOWN no access to source text] 9.1 ⟶ 9.1
	</div>
      </p>

      <p>A more extreme case of the the source text not being the same
	happens when the IDE just doesn't have access to the file at
	all. This is more likely to occur in debugging remotely which is
	prevalent nowadays. Or in problems in proprietary code where
	source code is intentionally not distributed.

    <ul>
      <li>Store hash of source text</li>

  <aside class="notes">
    <p>One obvious way to avoid this kind of problem is to
    store the source entire source text inside a debug file. The debug
    tables for Etherium Solidity work this way. The downside of this
    is that it might lead to huge debug files. Solidity programs,
    however, are generally very short.
    </p>

    <p>
      Instead of storing the entire source text, Python stores a
      checksum or hash of the source text in its bytecode file. Python
      selected its SIP hash function to be easy to compute, while
      keeping <i>low</i> the possibility false-positive collisions.
    </p>

    <p>
      In debug API protocols that work remotely, sometimes source text
      is sent across the network on request from the front-end. With
      this, a local IDE doesn't have to have the source text stored in
      a file locally. A downside of this is that a lot of information
      might be passed over the network if the front end does not cache
      source text.

      Now that we've described containers, we can focus on the part
      that most people think of when talking about a position: the
      location inside that container.
