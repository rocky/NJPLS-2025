	Can anything be done to get more accurate position numbers in
	those programming languages that only report line numbers, like
	Perl or the versions of Python for the first 25 years?</p>
      <p>Actually, yes.
      </p>


      <p>
	What I have done in Perl5 and Python, is write a
	<i>decompiler</i>. This starts out with the instructions
	produced and reconstructs source code. This is easier done
	when high-level intermediate code is interpreted. This is true
	in Python.  But it is also true for many other
	interpreters. Again, I did this as well for Perl5.
      </p>

      <p>After writing the decompiler for Python, I then hooked this
      into a gdb-like debugger that I also wrote for Python. [RUN CODE]
      </p>

      <p>
	First, I show the source text. It is what we had before, an
	expression with two divisions that raises
	a <i>ZeroDivision</i> error when run. When I run it using
	Python, we just get just the line number 2. No indication
	of <i>which</i> divide raised an error.
      </p>

      <p>
	Next, I run it under a debugger I wrote,
	called <i>trepan3k</i> so that when there is an error, it goes
	into the debugger's post-mortem handling. In that, there is
	a <i>deparse</i> command which takes deparses the program. For
	this, it uses a grammar and builds a parse tree from the
	instructions. Based on the parse tree, we can associate a
	range of source text at associated with any single
	instruction.
      </p>

      <p>So Here, we see <i>which</i> divide errored.</p>
      <p>
	The <i>--parent</i> option is just showing the parent text in
	addition to the text associated with the instruction. If the first
	divide errored, the parent context would have been: <i>6 / x</i>.
      </p>

      <p>
	Previously we mentioned that containers are
	hierarchical. Here, we see that locations <i>inside</i>
	containers can also be thought of as being hierarchical, when
	viewed from the standpoint of the program structure or parse
	tree.
      </p>

      <p>I have glossed over a lot of detail here, the last slide has
	links for more information and detail.
