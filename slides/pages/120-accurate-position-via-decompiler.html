	Can anything be done to get more accurate position numbers in
	those programming languages that only report line numbers, like
	Perl or the versions of Python for the first 25 years?</p>
      <p>Actually, yes.
      </p>


      <p>
	What I have done in Perl5 and Python, is write a
	decompiler. This starts out with the code produced and
	reconstructs source code. This is easier done when high-level
	bytecode is involved as in the case of Python, or where the
	interpretation is done on a tree structure which happens in
	Perl5 and Korn Shell.
      </p>

      <p>After writing the decompiler, I then hooked this into a gdb-like debugger.
      </p>

      <p>
	First, I show the source text. It is what we had before, an
	expression with two divisions that raises
	a <i>ZeroDivision</i> error when run. When I run it using
	Python, we just get just the line number 2. No indication
	of <i>which</i> divide raised an error.  In Python 3.13, this
	has been fixed though.
      </p>

      <p>
	Next, I run it under a debugger I wrote, called <i>trepan3k</i> so
	that when there is an error, it goes into the debugger's
	post-mortem handling. In that, there is a <i>deparse</i> command
	which takes deparses the program. For this it uses a grammar and
	builds a parse tree and from the instructions. Based on this
	parse tree, we can associate a range of source text.
      </p>

      <p>Here, we see <i>which</i> divide errored.</p>
      <p>
	The <i>--parent</i> option is just showing the parent text in
	addition to the text associated with the instruction. If the first
	divide errored the parent context would have been: <i>6 / x</i>.
      </p>

      <p>
	Previously we mentioned that containers are
	heirarchical. Here, we see that locations <i>inside</i>
	containers can also be thought of as being heirarchical when viewed
	from the standpoint of the program structure or parse tree.
      </p>

      <p>I have glossed over a lot of detail here, the last slide has
	links for more information and detail.
