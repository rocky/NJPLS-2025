	Can anything be done to get more accurate position numbers in
	those programming languages that only report line numbers, like
	Perl or the versions of Python for the first 25 years? Actually,
	yes.
      </p>


      <p>
	What I have done for both of these, is write a
	decompiler. This starts out with the code produced and
	reconstructs source code. This is easier done when high-level
	bytecode is involved as in the case of Python, or where the
	interpretation is done on a tree structure which happens in
	Perl5 and Korn Shell.
      </p>

      <p>After writing the decompiler, I then hooked this into a gdb-like debugger.
