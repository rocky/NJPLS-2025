    <p>I'd like to thank Richard Eisenberg, the NJPLS board and Jane
    Street Capital for giving me a venue which to speak. The last time
      I tried to reach out to the compiler community, it cost me $300 Euros, along with
      airfare, room and board to Malaga, Spain.
    </p>
    <p>
     And thank you all for listening to me. I with may help you in the great work you do in the future.
