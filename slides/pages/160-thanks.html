    <p>I'd like to thank Richard Eisenberg, the NJPLS board and Jane
      Street Capital for giving me a venue which to speak. The last time, 15 years ago,
      when I tried to reach out to the compiler community, it cost me $300 Euros, along with
      airfare, room and board to Malaga, Spain. And the audience had maybe 5 people.
    </p>
    <p>
     And thank you all for listening to me. I hope this with may help
     you or get you thinking about such things.
